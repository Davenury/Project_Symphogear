### Technologies

Technologies used in this "little" project:
* Python
* Pygame
* Unit tests library for Python (just for tests)

### Source Files

All of source files (sounds, music and images) come from Symphogear anime and Internet, so I don't have any rights to it (even if some of them are a bit modificated and I hope that the artists won't bit me :wink:). After all it's a simple game and we all should be happy with it :heart_eyes:

***

### Why

First of all it was supposed to be a simple game for me to understand the basics of Python language. Then I told about it to my friend, who thought it was a good idea, so I've worked with it for a bit. And then I understood how messy my code was, so I've started all from the beginning and here I am now. I don't know where it will lead me. It can be just some project that I won't even finish, but I wouldn't want to do it. I've started it and I want to end it for people, who like Symphogear as much as I do. For them to be one more time with characters we've benn watching for 5 seasons.

***

### Goal

My goal is simple: write a good game with some good story line. To write it for fans to be with the characters once again. To write it for people, who never heard about it but (I hope) will want to watch this anime and go through this path with us. Finally, to write it for me, to prove myself, that I can do some good things too.

### Instalation

To install this game (I wouldn't recommand it now, because it only has some unrelated lines of code right now), download this reopsitory (see the image below, if you don't know how).
