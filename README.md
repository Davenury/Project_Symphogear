### Contributors

Right now, I'm all alone with writing the code, but I have my friend, who who tests it. So... it's like the two of us, but one doesn't code, so... 1.5? Will it be?

***

### Technologies

Technologies used in this "little" project:
* Python
* Pygame
* Unit tests library for Python (just for tests)

***

### Source Files

All of source files (sounds, music and images) come from Symphogear anime and Internet, so I don't have any rights to it (even if some of them are a bit modificated and I hope that the artists won't bit me :wink:). After all it's a simple game and we all should be happy with it :heart_eyes:

***

### Why

First of all it was supposed to be a simple game for me to understand the basics of Python language. Then I told about it to my friend, who thought it was a good idea, so I've worked with it for a bit. And then I understood how messy my code was, so I've started all from the beginning and here I am now. I don't know where it will lead me. It can be just some project that I won't even finish, but I wouldn't want to do it. I've started it and I want to end it for people, who like Symphogear as much as I do. For them to be one more time with characters we've benn watching for 5 seasons.

***

### Goal

My goal is simple: write a good game with some good story line. To write it for fans to be with the characters once again. To write it for people, who never heard about it but (I hope) will want to watch this anime and go through this path with us. Finally, to write it for me, to prove myself, that I can do some good things too.

### Instalation
Before you start installation of this game, be sure, that you have installed Python (most preferably version 3). Don't know how? Check out this page ![Install Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)

To install this game (I wouldn't recommand it now, because it only has some unrelated lines of code right now), download this reopsitory (see the image below, if you don't know how).
![Download Repository](https://github.com/Davenury/Project_Symphogear/blob/master/markdown_images/Download_Repository.png)

Then you need to extract it (I think that's obvious enough). Then go to your command line (at this moment this game is testes on Windows, so I don't really know, how it will behave on Linux, etc.), change your directory (with `cd` command) to **Project_Sympohgear**. With `dir` command make sure, that there is a `requirements.txt` file. If there is (becuase there should be one), type:

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

And that should be it. Game is installed and ready to use (well, now it isn't, because, as I wrote earlier, it's only some unrelated classes, so you won't be doing anything with it, but hey! That's why this repo is private right now, yeah?).
***

### Inspiration

Inspiration for this little project was an anime called "Senki Zesshou Symphogear", which I want to recommand you to watch, because it's worth your time. It doens't matter if you are 15 or 50 (if you are younger, don't watch it. It isn't very scary, but it has some things, that you shouldn't watch right now. Either you won't understand it or get scared about it, and I will need to apologize. Do I need that? Hell, no!).

***

### To Do Before Play

Main questline of this game (at least I think now) will be set after the final of season 5, so if you don't want to have a bunch of spoliers, first watch the anime. Of course there's something I need to do before you'll be even able to start to think about playing. I need to write it first :hushed: .

***

### Main Quest

For this moment, I'm not quite sure what will be the main questline for this game, but we'll figure something out for sure!

### How to help?

If you want to help us with this "little" project, you can do it in two ways:

* If you can code in Python language (or any other language, tbh, because Python is easy enough to learn) and:
  * you have some experience and you're eager
      Write to me (dawid199960@gmail.com) and become a full contributor to this "little" project.
  * you don't have experience, but you are eager
      Also write to me (dawid199960@gmail.com). You can learn some new things and write it in your CV (if you aren't ashamed enough).
      
* If you can't code in any language and don't want to learn it:
  * if you like testing something and think, you'll do it good:
      Test this project and write to me (dawid199960@gmail.com) with all the bugs / mistakes you've found (for example: music isn't playing, game doesn't start, etc.)
      
  * if you like testing, but you aren't sure you'll do it good:
      Don't be scared, we won't eat you alive, because you could mess up something. We're all just humans after all, right?
